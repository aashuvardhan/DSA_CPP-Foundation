'''
Given two strings of lowercase alphabets and a value K, your task is to complete the given function 
which tells if  two strings are K-anagrams of each other or not.

Two strings are called K-anagrams if both of the below conditions are true.
1. Both have same number of characters.
2. Two strings can become anagram by changing at most K characters in a string.

Example:

Input:
str1 = "fodr", str2="gork"
k = 2
Output:
1
Explanation: Can change fd to gk
Your Task:
Since this is a function problem, you don't need to take any input.
Just complete the given function areKAnagrams that returns true if the
strings can be turned into K-anagrams, else return false.
