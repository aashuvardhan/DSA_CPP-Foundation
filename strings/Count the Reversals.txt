Given a string S consisting of only opening and closing 
curly brackets '{' and '}', find out the minimum number 
of reversals required to convert the string into a balanced expression.
A reversal means changing '{' to '}' or vice-versa.

Example 1:

Input:
S = "}{{}}{{{"
Output: 3
Explanation: One way to balance is:
"{{{}}{}}". There is no balanced sequence
that can be formed in lesser reversals.
â€‹Example 2:

Input: 
S = "{{}{{{}{{}}{{"
Output: -1
Explanation: There's no way we can balance
this sequence of braces.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything.
Your task is to complete the function countRev() 
which takes the string S as input parameter and
returns the minimum number of reversals required
to balance the bracket sequence. If balancing is not possible, return -1. 

Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1 ≤ |S| ≤ 105
